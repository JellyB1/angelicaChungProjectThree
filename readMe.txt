Project Description:

By using dichotomous questions, I will create a quiz that will suss out the players Myer's Briggs Personality Type (MBPT) and assign a Harry Potter house. The questions will be derived from OG questions from the MBPT (found from the MBPT site). Upon completion, the user's MBPT personality type will be displayed, as well as the related house. There will also be a description of the personality type (again sourced from the MBPT site).

Psuedo Code: 
take MBPT and return HP house
1. User will be able to select 1 of 2 radio buttons to answer question;
2. Each choice will increment variable for that trait (ie: let extrovert = 0; extrovert++);
3. Upon submit of form, variable pairs will be compared and the higher variable will be denoted
	ex: 	extrovert = 3
			introvert = 2
			if (extrovert > introvert) {
				return "E"
			}
4. The representative letters from each pair will be displayed to DOM as a string;
5. The matching Harry Potter house name will be retrieved by string and displayed to DOM;
6. The description of MBPT matching the string will be displayed to DOM;

Stretch goals:
1.	Customize questions related to Harry Potter;
2. 	Customize personality summaries to relate to Harry Potter;
3.	Turn questions from dichotomous to a 6-point Likert scale;
